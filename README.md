#  Library Management System 

##  Project Overview
This project is a **Library Management Database** built using SQL.  
It manages:
- Books
- Members
- Borrow/Return records
- Fines

The project demonstrates database design, normalization, and useful SQL queries for real-world scenarios.

## Database Schema
The database consists of 3 main tables:

- **Books**: Stores details about books in the library.  
- **Members**: Stores details about library members.  
- **BorrowRecords**: Tracks which member borrowed which book, return date, and fine.

  ##  Files in this Project
- `schema.sql` → Database & tables creation  
- `data.sql` → Sample dataset  
- `queries.sql` → Useful SQL queries  


##  How to Run
1. Open MySQL or any SQL database tool.  
2. Run `schema.sql` to create the database and tables.  
3. Run `data.sql` to insert sample data.  
4. Run queries from `queries.sql` to test the system.  

## Sample Queries
